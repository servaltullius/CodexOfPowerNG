# Codex of Power NG v1.0.0 (2026-02-08)

First public release of **Codex of Power NG**.

## Highlights
- NG runtime/UX focused release built around Prisma UI.
- Legacy Codex/SVCollection residue is now detected and warned at runtime.
- Repository/runtime cleanup removes legacy MCM, Papyrus, and SVCollection payloads.

## User-facing changes
- Prisma UI menu with EN/KO text and language override.
- Inventory performance improvements (pagination + virtualized rows).
- High-DPI input alignment improvements with `Input scale` and keyboard fallback controls.

## Compatibility notice
- This is a new mod line and is **not** compatible with Codex of Power / SVCollection saves/settings.
- If upgrading from old setup, remove stale legacy MCM files:
  - `MCM/Settings/SVCollection.ini`
  - `MCM/Settings/keybinds.json` entries with `modName: SVCollection`

## Package
- Primary artifact: `Codex of Power NG.zip` (MO2-ready)
