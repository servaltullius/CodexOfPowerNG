# Codex of Power NG v1.0.2 (2026-02-08)

Patch release for Quick Register correctness and documentation clarity.

## Highlights
- Ammo entries now appear under **Weapons** instead of **Misc**.
- Quick Register count display now uses live inventory count logic.
- README/Nexus requirements now include direct dependency links.

## User-facing changes
- Cases like "Ancient Nord Arrow" no longer look like a misc item with confusing category.
- Item counts in Quick Register better match actual in-game owned quantity.
- Setup is easier with clickable links for SKSE / Prisma UI / Address Library / Media Keys Fix.

## Package
- Primary artifact: `Codex of Power NG.zip` (MO2-ready)
